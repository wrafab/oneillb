	<h1><font color="white"> Week Seven!! </font></h1>
	
	<h2><font color="white"> What We Did! </font></h2>
	
	<br>
	
	<p><font color="white"> This week we learned a bit of basic electronics lingo, how to use electronics, and how to solder.</font></p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h2><font color="white"> Vocabulary, Charts, and More! </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white"> capacitor: an electrical used to store energy temporarily </font></p>
	<p><font color="white">	transistor: a semi-conducter used to amplify or switch electronic symbols </font></p>
	<p><font color="white">	resistor: a device having a designed resistance to the passage of an electric current </font></p>
	<p><font color="white">	led: a light-emitting diode diode: a semi-conductor with only one flow </font></p>
	<p><font color="white">	potentiometer: a meter that measures the amount of light </font></p>
	<p><font color="white">	breadboard: a place where most electronics are hooked into </font></p>
	<p><font color="white">	multimeter: an electronic measuring device used to check the voltage, current, and resistance</font></p>
	<p><font color="white">	switch: a device the connects or disconnects the connection in a circuit </font></p>

	<p><font color="white"> Ohm's Law is Voltage = Resistance * Current.  To measure the amount of resistance on a resistor, add the first two colors and multiply by the third.  The fourth band is the accuracy (room for failure) of the resistor. </font></p>
	
	<br>
	
	<h2><font color="white"> Electronic Exercises. </font></h2> 
	
	<p><font color="white"> I did 15 electronic exercises and projects to help me familiarize myself with how electronics work.  I learned the difference between capacitors, resistors, transitors, diodes, LEDS, and more.</font></p>

	<h2><font color="white"> Soldering. </font></h2>
		
	<p><font color="white"> Soldering was pretty hard at first, but got a lot easier as time went on.  Getting the solder material to drop onto the board at the perfect amonut was difficult, but went a lot faster as time went on.
