	<p><font color="white"> Hello!  My name is Brigette and I am currently a sophomore at Western Reserve Academy!  I really love skiing, making, and playing ukulele even though I'm really bad at it!  I'm also quite fond of studying since I really need to work hard in school to be able to pass, so why not make the whole thing mroe enjoyable and actually like the things I'm assigned to do every night!  I also play on JV Volleyball, I fence, and play on JV lacrosse.   </font></p>

	<p><font color="white"> This year I will be participating in FabAcademy and will try to go to Fab15, New Cairo Egypt!  This summer I had the pleasure on joining my father and going to Fab14, Tolouse, France!  It was an amazing experience I will never forget.  While we were flying out from Boston to Paris, I had the great experience of meeting Neil Gershenfeld, Mrs. Gershenfeld, and their son in the AirFrance waiting room.  It's a moment I will never forget.  When it was time for my father to graduate, I saw a few girls from Iceland come up and get their diplomas.  They were young, highschool girls like me.  They inspired me to do FabAcademy as a sophomore in highschool and become one of the youngest graduates in the world.  </font></p>
