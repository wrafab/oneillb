	<p><font color="white"> This week we did Arduino.  Arduino was created by Massimo Banzi to help his students learn how to use advanced electronics as well.  He made an IUD and a board that connects to a computer.  Arduino allows the user to learn how to program with electronics, not just one and not the other. </font></p>

	<p><font color="white"> The Arduino projects were mostly easy, but tedious.  When I got to Project 5 I was already so tired of having to place wires every single place that I felt like I was rushing through it.  After it was all done I was ready to roll. </font></p>

	<p><font color="white">  The change to the code that I made with Arduino was making the LED in the first project blink faster.  I did that by changing the break between flickers from 1000 to 200. </font></p>
