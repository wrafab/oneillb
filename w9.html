	<h1><font color="white"> Week Nine! </font></h1>
	
	<br>
	
	<p><font color="white"> This week we did Arduino.  Arduino was created by Massimo Banzi to help his students learn how to use advanced electronics as well.  He made an IUD and a board that connects to a computer.  Arduino allows the user to learn how to program with electronics, not just one and not the other. We had 5 projects that we had to complete and each of those projects had little subprojects. </p>  
	
	<br>	
		
	<p><font color="white> First, we had a project focused around using Arduino with light.  Our four subprojects in that were making an LED blink, a potentiometer, a photoresistor, and an RGB Night-Light.</font></p> 

	<br>
		
	<p><font color="white> Next, we had a project focused on Arduino and sound.  We first had to make a buzzer, then a digital trumpet, then a really annoying Digital Simon Says game that drove me crazy trying to beat.  I changed up the code for the trumpet a bit so that the notes would change and so I could play a different song.  </font></p>
		
	<p><font color="white"> The Arduino projects were mostly easy, but tedious.  When I got to Project 5 I was already so tired of having to place wires every single place that I felt like I was rushing through it.  After it was all done I was ready to roll. </font></p>

	<p><font color="white">  The change to the code that I made with Arduino was making the LED in the first project blink faster.  I did that by changing the break between flickers from 1000 to 200. </font></p>
