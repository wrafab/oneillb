	<h2><font color="white"> Corel Draw and Sublimation! </font></h2>
	
	<br>
	
	<p><font color="white"> For week three, I learned how to use Corel draw and different sublimation techniques.  I printed a T-Shirt on the Brother GT-361 T-Shirt printer, two pencil pounches on the sublimation printer, and a ____ on the UV Printer.  Learning how all these machines work and function were all intersting.  First, sublimation printers have to use special paper and ink in order to work properly.  The step first includes turning liquids into solids by heating them up a bunch, then printing them out in the printer.  Before you do any printing though, its important to mirror your design on Corel Draw. If you don't mirror your design, it will come out backwards and wont be of any use.  After your design in printed, read the directions on the websites provided by Mr. Gerber.  </font></p>

	<h2><font color="white"> What I Made </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white"> Since I used a pencil pouch, I had to pre-iron my pouch between two pieces of regular paper for 10 seconds at 400 degrees farenheit.  Then, I taped my design to the pencil pouch on the area I wanted it to be on.  After that, I put the pencil pouch between the two pieces of paper from before and back in the iron for 60 seconds at 400 degrees.  When the timer was up, I quickly took out my pouch and made sure to not touch any of the metal parts.  I set down my project and took off the transfer piece.  My pouch was complete and just had to cool down.  Taking out the object you want to sublimate on right as the timer goes off is important, especially if you want to make sure it doesnt cook too long and get blurry.  </font></p>
