	<h2><font color="white"> CNC Milling </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white">  CNC Milling was a bit difficult at first. I first picked a clip art image of a pumpkin, then went to Corel Draw.  I turned it into a .dfx and put it into Fusion 360.  Then I exported it as an .stl.  I made sure my mold would be big enough to make a sizeable amount of candy, but still fit the wax. </font></p>
		
	<p><font color="white">  I set up the machine with Mr. Gerber so that the mill would properly cut my molding wax.  I set the origin and the x, y, and z coordinates.  After that, I was ready to go mill.  We used the CNC Machine and it took about 4 hours to complete.  Afterwards, I had to break off the surrounding parts and make a more cardboard surrounding since my wax border was so thin and frail. After that, my class together mixed our silicone together.  We used a 2:10 ratio of Smooth-Sil 960, vacuumed the air bubbles out of it to degas it, and waited 24 hours after pouring our mold in order for it to set.  After tha, we pryed them out and poured molten chocolate into our molds.</font></p>

	<h2><font color="white"> Longboard Making </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white"> Making my longboard was very different from the other processes.  I did not use CAD to make the actual base of the longboard (but I did use CAD for making the sticker) and mainly worked on it in the woodshop. Instead of vacuum forming my longboard like the other skateboards, I had to use a few clamps to press it down.  The flexible pieces of wood were vertically cut while the firm ones were horizontal.  They were stacked firm on flexible and glued quickly. </font></p>
