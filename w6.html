	<h2><font color="white"> CNC Milling </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white">  CNC Milling was a bit difficult at first. I first picked a clip art image of a pumpkin, then went to Corel Draw.  I turned it into a ____ and put it into Fusion 360.  I made sure my mold would be big enough to make a sizeable amount of candy, but still fit the wax. </font></p>
		
	<p><font color="white">  I set up the machine with Mr. Gerber so that the mill would properly cut my molding wax.  I set the origin and the x, y, and z coordinates.  After that, I was ready to go mill.  We used the _____ Machine and it took about 4 hours to complete.  Afterwards, I had to break off the surrounding parts and make a more cardboard surrounding since my wax border was so thin and frail. </font></p>
