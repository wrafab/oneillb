	<h2><font color="white"> Autodesk Fusion 360 </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white"> Getting the hang of Autodesk was kind of hard at first, but I eventually got it.  Learning how to extrude was a bit harder.  I feel like sketcing with a tablet and a pencil would end up being easier than using a mouse.  My hand felt shaky while drawing rectangles and such.  A lot of what I did didn't end up working so well, especially when I was trying to flip between axes.  I started sketching a bit more of my final project.  Overall, Autodesk Fusion 360 worked well!</font></p>

	<h2><font color="white"> What I made. </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white"> I made a few different designs.  Six of them were given to me from my teacher, Mr. Gerber, and one of the other ones was a hinge.  The hinge was probably one of the hardest things to do.  Extruding the different parts was good warmup for my other designs, but it ended up taking a bunch of time.  I wasn't able to print it, but will soon!</font></p>

	<p><font color="white"> This was the first challenge we had to make during class.  We were given about 30 minutes to follow the exact drawn design and translate it into AutoDesk Fusion 360.</font></p>

	<p><font color="white">This was the hinge I made on Fusion 360.  I spent a majority of my time on it, which made it harder to do my other designs below.  I used a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvY4laqJZPM">Youtube Tutorial Video on How To Make a Hinge in Fusion 360</a> which I found to be very helpful. </font></p>

	<p><font color="white"> Some of the designs were harder to make than others, but I still got through with most of them.  After I finished making them, I felt much more well-versed in using Fusion 360.</font></p>
