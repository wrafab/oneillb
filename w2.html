	<h2><font color="white"> Autodesk Fusion 360 </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white"> Getting the hang of Autodesk was kind of hard at first, but I eventually got it.  Learning how to extrude was a bit harder.  I feel like sketcing with a tablet and a pencil would end up being easier than using a mouse.  My hand felt shaky while drawing rectangles and such.  A lot of what I did didn't end up working so well, especially when I was trying to flip between axes.  I started sketching a bit more of my final project.  Overall, Autodesk Fusion 360 worked well!</font></p>

	<h2><font color="white"> What I made. </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white"> I made a few different designs.  Six of them were given to me from my teacher, Mr. Gerber, and one of the other ones was a hinge.  The hinge was probably one of the hardest things to do.  Extruding the different parts was good warmup for my other designs, but it ended up taing a bunch of time.  I wasn't able to print it, but will soon!</font></p>
