	<h2><font color="white"> Corel Draw and Using the Laser! </font></h2>
	
	<br>
	
	<p><font color="white"> For week four, I learned how to use Corel draw and different laser cutting/engraving technique.  After I got my deisgns down, I made sure to hairline what I wanted to vector and left the stuff I wanted to raster alone.  To vector means to cut on the laser while raster is to engrave.  </font></p>
	
	<h2><font color="white"> What I Made </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white"> First, I measured out the clock piece I was using with a Vernier scale.  A Vernier scale helped me find the exact width of the clock piece.  This helped me fit it properly when cutting my design.  First, I took a picture of a bunch of bare trees from a winter day.  Then, I got a clip-art design of a snowflake.  I made a circle with a diameter of 10 and PowerCliped the trees inside of the circle frame.  I took the frame of the circle and selected it.  I hairlined it afterwards and started hairlining my snowflakes.  I hairlined them so they would be recognized by the laser that they needed to be cut out.  Once my design was complete, I saved it as a .cdr to a flashdrive and brought it over to the Epilog Laser.  I plugged it into the computer that ran with the laser and opened my file through Corel Draw again. I hit print and got this screen.

	<p><font color="white"> Preferences allowed me to change the laser's settings to fit my needs.  I needed to cut and engrave a 12x24 inch piece of 1/8 thick wood.  I needed to change the settings of the laser so that I could raster and vector it properly.  For rastering (engraving), I needed 50 for speed and 100 for power.  For vectoring (cutting), I needed to have 8 for speed, 100 for power, and 20 for frequency.  Then I changed the length of my board in the piece size section.  This is very important, especially since it starts with the height and width of a piece of paper, 11x8.5.  I made sure to change the settings to have 24 inches for the width and 12 inches for the height.  Then I pressed okay and applied my settings.  I made sure that the printer I was sending it to was the Epilog and hit print.
