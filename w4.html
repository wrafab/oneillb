	<h2><font color="white"> What I Made </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white"> Since I used a pencil pouch, I had to pre-iron my pouch between two pieces of regular paper for 10 seconds at 400 degrees farenheit.  Then, I taped my design to the pencil pouch on the area I wanted it to be on.  After that, I put the pencil pouch between the two pieces of paper from before and back in the iron for 60 seconds at 400 degrees.  When the timer was up, I quickly took out my pouch and made sure to not touch any of the metal parts.  I set down my project and took off the transfer piece.  My pouch was complete and just had to cool down.  Taking out the object you want to sublimate on right as the timer goes off is important, especially if you want to make sure it doesnt cook too long and get blurry.  As for the T-Shirt I made, I used Corel Draw to fully encompass and represent Ohio.  First, I took a picture of people doing the OHIO pose and framed it inside a clipart image of Ohio.  Then, I uploaded the image to GTX and started fitting it to my T-Shirt.  I pre-ironed my T-Shirt to make sure that there were no wrinkles or creases, then put it on the Brother GT-361 printer.  I made sure both sides were even and hit Print Data Load on the screen.  After that, the printer started making my design.  After it was finished, I took the T-Shirt out and ironed it again to get rid of any moisture in the ink.  This step is very important if you don't want any spotches of wet ink anywhere from rubbing one part on another.  After that, my T-Shirt was complete.</font></p>

	<p><font color="white"> I also made a pop socket for one of my friends.  I used a clip of her art and used the circle tool to clip in image inside so it would fit on the popsocket.</font></p>
