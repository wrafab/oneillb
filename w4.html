	<h2><font color="white"> Corel Draw and Using the Laser! </font></h2>
	
	<br>
	
	<p><font color="white"> For week four, I learned how to use Corel draw and different laser cutting/engraving technique.  After I got my deisgns down, I made sure to hairline what I wanted to vector and left the stuff I wanted to raster alone.  To vector means to cut on the laser while raster is to engrave.  </font></p>
	
	<h2><font color="white"> What I Made </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white"> First, I measured out the clock piece I was using with a Vernier scale.  A Vernier scale helped me find the exact width of the clock piece.  This helped me fit it properly when cutting my design.  First, I took a picture of a bunch of bare trees from a winter day.  Then, I got a clip-art design of a snowflake.  I made a circle with a diameter of 10 and PowerCliped the trees inside of the circle frame.  I took the frame of the circle and selected it.  I hairlined it afterwards and started hairlining my snowflakes.  I hairlined them so they would be recognized by the laser that they needed to be cut out.
