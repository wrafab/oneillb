	<h2><font color="white"> The Start of Something New </font></h2>

	<h2><font color="white"> Team Design Challenges </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white">  The team design challenges were a bit shaky.  I was paired with Karthik and Ramsey.  I felt like I was very left out at first until I argued my ideas.  A few of my ideas that ended up winning the team one of the two challenges was fitting cones of newspaper on top of eachother. The apex of the cone would help support the next cone.  We used our tape to wrap the bottom of the cone to the top.  Our structure was unbalanced, but with a bit more of paper on the side we were able to weigh the structure down. </font></p>

	<h2><font color="white"> HTML Coding </font></h2>
	
	<p><font color="white"> Coding in week one was kind of rough at first.  Coding in HMTL using just GitHub, Notepad++, and refreshing so much that I thought I would get carpeltunnel in 2.4 days was quite the experience.  Luckily, my father introduced Dreamweaver to me.  I coded all of my HTML in Dreamweaver and was very happy by being able to see the live changes happen right in front of me opposed to having to refresh a bunch after a single change. Dreamweaver will continue to be an importnat tool for me later on in FabAcademy. </font></p>

	<p> One other new thing I learned how to do was use BlueJeans.  BlueJeans is an online video call app mainly used for buisnesses.  Although it is very similar to Google Hangouts, BlueJeans is prefered due to the amount of people it can hold.  BlueJeans is where I will be watching video calls during class on Wednesday.  I am very excited about the process!
