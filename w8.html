	<p><font color="white"> Embroidery was one of the most interesting activities.  The machine we use stiches at about 700 stiches per minute, allowing for quick and professional designs.  The program on their has it's own CAD that allows you to type what you would like to have on the thing you are embroidering. First, you must loop your hat.  To loop your hat, you have to first put in on the looping board with one part of the magnet under the part of the hat you want to embroider.  Then, you put two layers of paper-like material to hold the stiches in.  Then, you press down and set the loop up.  Once you take the loop out of the machine, you can bring it to the embroiderer and start programming what you would like on the hat. The WRA Logo was saved in the machine already, so it wasn't hard to decide what I wanted to make.</font></p>
	
	<br>
	
	<p><font color="white"> Running the machine was the easiest part.  First, you gave a designated amount of space for where your design could be stitched in.  After that, you choose the font or design that you want to embroider onto your hat. If you choose text, quickly choose the size of the text and type it out on the touchscreen.  Next, choose your spool of thread.  I used white thread since I was making a Reserve green hat. </font></p>

	<p><font color="white"> Sewing was another fun part.  We learned how to sew with Mrs. Ong and Mrs. Howell.  Both of them were fantastic teachers.  First we learned some of the different speeds and parts of the sewing machine.  Then we learned how thread our machines.  After we practiced on a scrap sheet of green fabric, we started making our pillowcases.  We made a 'burrito' pillowcase, mainly because the process was kind of like wrapping a burrito.  First, we chose our material and cut the different lengths.  24 in. for the body, 2 inches for between the cuff and body, and 12 inches for the cuff.  My material was soft and Christmas themed so I could have a nice present for someone.  Then, we lined up our pieces and started pinning them together.  After we got parts of them sewn, we pinned it again.  I sewed mine again and pinned it up one last time before rolling it into a burrito.  Once I was finished, I sewed the part again and pulled out the rest of the pillow case.  I had actually messed up and my pillow case wasn't fully complete, but Mrs. Ong offered to fix it up for me.  The next day, I finished sewing the other sides up and doing a French seam so that my pillow case looked sharp and polished.</font></p>
