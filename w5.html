	<h2><font color="white"> 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing! </font></h2>
	
	<br>
	
	<p><font color="white"> For week five, I learned how to 3D Print properly, use MeshMixer, and Makerbot.  We had three challenges and had to complete them by the end of the rotation.  We learned the difference between subtractive, additive, and formative manufacturing.  We used additive manufacturing with 3D printing.

	<p><font color="white"> I made my ball inside a cube to complete the 'make something that cannot be made with subtractive manufacturing.'  I first made the design on AutoDesk Fusion 360, exported it to MeshMixer, then saved it as an STL.  I opened it in MakerBot, then sized it to my preferred size.  After that, I saved it as a MakerBot file and printed it.  The machine had to warm up before hand though.  It only took 14 minutes though!</p>
