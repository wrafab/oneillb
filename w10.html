	<h1><font color="white"> Week 10:  The Final Countdown. </font></h1>
	
	<br>
	
	<p><font color="white"> This week we made our final projects.  This was the week I anticipated to be the hardest, especially since midterms were coming up and I was already stressed out because of the amount of work I had to spend on studying for those, but my final project was quiet simple.  I used processes I was quite familiar with and made the whole thing low budget. I thought of my idea well before school started just to make sure I wouldn't waste any days thinking.  I decided to make a prototype volleyball mat since I'm to lazy to walk across the court to pick up multiple balls.  This project is a rough draft of a project I will try to complete during FabAcademy.  My 'final' final project will most likely be hooked together and hooked onto a wall.  I got this idea from a lacrosse backboard, but serving in volleyball is different that passing in lacrosse.  The server needs to hit at a certain speed and height to make sure that the volleyball gets over the net. When I update this project, I hope to include a process where I can measure the total speed of the volleyball after it is hit.  I'll measure the speed later with Arduino, a few different sensors, and a different design.  I hope that this project will help all lazy sports people by making this and eliminating having to walk the court to practice serving more. </font></p>
